#### Master's thesis
Explored the use of deep learning, specifically Transformer-based models, for classifying femoral fractures using fusion of electronic health records and radiographic images. Built and compared 5 different models with 2 models using attention-based fusion; unimodal tabular, unimodal vision, multimodal late fusion, multimodal intra-attention fusion, multimodal inter-attention fusion. Implemented MC Dropout to account for prediction uncertainties per image and aggregated predictions to patient-level using uncertainties.

#### Bachelor's thesis
Analyzed the impact of digital marketing spend across multiple channels through mix marketing modeling on new customer acquisition for a fintech company. Built and compared XGBoost models with various transformations to capture carryover effects and seasonal patterns. Used SHAP values to interpret non-linear relationships and provided recommendations for optimal marketing budget allocation across channels.
